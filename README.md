Create a clean, flat, poster-style HR recruitment poster on a pure white background. Use bold, simple geometry and large flat color blocks (no textures or gradients). Layout and typography instructions — place elements exactly as described:

Top area (large headline, centered):
HEADLINE: "JOIN OUR TEAM"

Below headline (medium subtitle, centered):
SUBTITLE: "Grow • Belong • Succeed"

Body area (left column — bulleted benefits, each on its own line):
- "Competitive pay and benefits"
- "Flexible working hours"
- "Clear career paths and mentorship"
- "Inclusive, diverse culture"

Body area (right column — short role descriptions, each on its own line):
- "Product Manager — Lead feature strategy"
- "Software Engineer — Build reliable systems"
- "UX Designer — Create delightful experiences"
- "People Ops — Support employee growth"

Call to action (large, centered button-style area near bottom):
CTA LINE: "Apply Now — careers@example.com"

Footer (small legal / contact, centered at very bottom):
FOOTER: "Equal opportunity employer • Visit example.com/careers • +1 (555) 123-4567"

Design details:
- Large typographic hierarchy: headline largest, CTA prominent, footer smallest.
- Use clear spacing and left/right two-column body alignment as described.
- Leave a small empty top-right corner area (about 8% of width) for a logo.
- Render the on-image text exactly as written (keep punctuation, capitalization).
- Poster-style, flat color blocks for clothing/props that strongly favor the HR palette you were given; keep the background pure white.
- Avoid photoreal textures — prefer vector/graphic look so palette colors appear as solid blocks.
